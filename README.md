# Goal: To share useful resources about Self-Sovereign Identity

I will try to keep these up to date as I discover new resources and learn more about this space. Pull requests welcome.

# What is Self-Sovereign Identity?
"Lifetime portable identity for and person, organisation, or thing that does not depend on any centralised authority and cannot be taken away" - Drummond Reed, Chief Trust Officer Evernym 

For a great introductory video watch [The Story of Open SSI Standards - Drummond Reed/Evernym SSIMeetup.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RllH91rcFdE)

# Decentralised Identifiers (DID)
Information about DID's
* [DID W3C specification](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/)

# Decentralised Key Management

# DID Authentication

# Verifiable Credentials

# Internet standards groups 
Devloping standards for self-sovereign identity is important so that different companies solutions are interoperable. These are the main internet standards bodies that I know about. They are currently working on developing standards for DID's, Decentralised Key Management, DID Auth and Verifiable Credentials.
